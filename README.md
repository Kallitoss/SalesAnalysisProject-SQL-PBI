# SalesAnalysisProject-SQL-PBI
The repository contains all files from scratch to the end of the project.
1. DATABASE used for this project was AdventureWorksDW from the internet.
2. Steven sent an imaginary business request.
3. The business demand overview and user stories were created from the business request, so the project could be done accordingly.
4. After analysis, the tables that were picked for this project were properly cleansed to be relieved from unnecessary data.
5. Results of cleansed tables from SQL were extracted into Excel files for visualization needs.
6. As the last step of the project, three Microsoft Power BI dashboards that contain everything that Steven wanted have been created: Sales Overview, Customer Details, and Product Details
